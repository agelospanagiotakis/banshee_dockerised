Upgrading
=========

Before you start building a website with Banshee, you must understand how to
upgrade it to the next release. Banshee is a framework, with ready to use
modules. Those modules are MVC modules and its files are located in the
directories controllers, models and views. Most modules also have a stylesheet,
which is located in public/css. Optionally, a module can have a javascript,
which is located in public/js.

The framework part of Banshee can be found in libraries/banshee. You are
advised not to change those files. Banshee also uses other libraries from the
libraries directory. Only change those libraries if you know what you're doing
and document your changes.

Before upgrading your website, make a backup. To upgrade your Banshee-based
website to a new version, install a new version of Banshee and copy your
modules to that new Banshee installation. You can use the import function of
the module and layout scripts for that. Use the /setup page to update the
database.
